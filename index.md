The cloud is a fancy name for the huge network of computers that host your favorite websites,
stream movies, and shop online, but you can also harness all of that computing power for
running analyses that would take days, weeks or even years on your local computer.

In this lesson, you'll learn about renting cloud services that fit your analytic needs,
and how to interact with one of those services (AWS) via the command line.
